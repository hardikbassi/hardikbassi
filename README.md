## About

What brought you doing is what you are doing? I was Inspired for programming by the fact that anything we say to a computer can be achieved. Like humans, it doesn‚Äôt complain when we tell them to do something. And if we use this power correctly, we can increase productivity and utilize time efficiently.  And programming is the fastest and the most customisable way to communicate to computer. I believe that there is a long journey ahead of me and I have just got started. I aspire to become a programmer and a full stack developer. ‚ÄúI first started with learning python. After my tuitions were finished, I used to go straight into my computer and started programming. I first made a ‚ÄúPersonal Assistant‚Äù like Alexa that listened to all the commands & answered reasonably. Then, I started making many more program. Then, I felt one language is not sufficient because there are also other languages that will help me achieve a specific goal more efficiently than other.

My strength include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem solving, responsive design principles and Computer Vision. So far I have JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C#, Python, Bootstrap,- ASP.NET, NodeJS , JDBC/JavaSQL , OpenCV(Python) , AWS Recognition , EC2  and Selenium(Java and Python) and Git/GitHub under my belt. I've started learning Tensorflow to learn how to give human-like brains to machine. I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head.
